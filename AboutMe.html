    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Obama A</strong>, a junior transfer student from Texas, currently majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a minor in <strong>History</strong>. I’m passionate about exploring the intersection between technology and the humanities, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges in both areas.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics, I’m an outdoor enthusiast who loves <strong>rock climbing</strong>, going on <strong>hikes</strong>, attending <strong>concerts</strong>, and <strong>thrifting</strong>. I also enjoy spending time with friends, whether it’s exploring new places or just relaxing together.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I indulge my passion for <strong>coding games</strong> and <strong>volunteering at an animal shelter</strong>, where I find joy in giving back to the community. These activities fuel my creativity and keep me grounded, and they also allow me to combine my love for technology with making a positive impact.</p>
